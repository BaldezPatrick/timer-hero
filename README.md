# Time Hero

A simple timer built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project consists of a timer that can be started, paused, and restarted using interactive buttons. The time is displayed in a 24-hour format (hh:mm:ss) and is updated every second. Also, this is a project to show all the power of dynamism that JS offers to pages for manipulating the DOM.
